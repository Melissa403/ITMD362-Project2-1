# ITMD362-Project2

A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point:

Although I am only beginner/intermediate at CSS, I do feel that I learned both how to write my code better and also how to structure the elements of a page. Before this class I would not have taken the time to think of how to make the IIT website better or even identify exactly what I would change. I think this class and project have helped me consider the different parts of what makes up a good human/computer experience.

A 3-4 sentence critique of each group memberâ€™s work on the project.
Andrzej: Andrzej did a good job of getting the group together and organizing the Gitcommits. He was very helpful and open to suggestions. He was good in the PM role.

Peter: Peter wrote some of the login script and which helped immensely. He was also open to suggestions/communication. It was clear he was trying to understand and participate in the project.

Nick: Nick was immensely helpful in writing and sctructuring our code. He is very good at analyzing the current structure of the IIT page in order to replicate or change. He was also very good about details like color matching.

Me: I think I did a good job at participation. I tried to help organize our meetups and contribute design ideas/code. I also tried to ask/remind the team about the deliverables for our project.
